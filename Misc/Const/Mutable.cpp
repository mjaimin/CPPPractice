//when you want to declare a const object, but you want to change member variable at run time, use mutable
//Sometimes there is requirement to modify one or more data members of class / struct through const function even though you donâ€™t want the function to update other members of class / struct. This task can be easily performed by using mutable keyword 
class A
{
public:
    A() : x(4), y(5), z(6) { };
    mutable int x;
    int y;
    const int z; // interview question, Can you put const in side class declaration?
    //Ans yes. Pass value in initialization list. This is must otherwise compilation error
};
 
int main()
{
    const A var1;
    A var2;
    var1.x = 345;
    //  var1.y = 2345;//Error because var1 is const but int y is not mutable
    var2.x = 345;
    var2.y = 2345;
}
