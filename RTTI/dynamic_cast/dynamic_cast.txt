to cast an object, dynamic_cast performs run time type identification.
When you attempt to do a cast using the dynamic_cast operator, a run time check is made to see if this is a safe cast,
and if the cast is unsafe then this the cast returns NULL. Thus by checking for NULL, we can determine whether the cast
attempt was successful or not.
