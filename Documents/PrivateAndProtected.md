If the inheritance is **public**, everything that is aware of Base and Child is also aware that Child inherits from Base.

If the inheritance is **protected**, only Child, and its children, are aware that they inherit from Base.

If the inheritance is **private**, no one other than Child is aware of the inheritance.
